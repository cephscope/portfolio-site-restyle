Using the Tone.js library, I designed sounds and sequences to be controlled by the user. Each layer can be played solo or alongside the others, inviting you to explore the soundscape at your leisure. To maximise immersion, I created animations using the P5.js API and synced them to the audio. I wanted the interface to be as minimal as possible: just images and sound. It\'s designed so that there isn\'t a wrong move to make â€” just start clicking around enjoy what you create.',
